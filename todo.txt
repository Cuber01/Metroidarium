Gameplay:
- player bullets need to be faster
- player needs to always know which snake direction is which - add arrows or smth
- player needs to know when his modules are done reloading - add animation via shader?
- movement still feels finicky, hopefully a dash will help
- areas should be mostly open

Enemies - Content ideas:
- kamikaze enemy that gets nearby and explodes
- ship that tries to run'n gun you (similarly to how the player does it to enemies)
- bot with bioimplants - two phases, first bio second robotic. Robotic shooots rockets from afar, bio is a frog that jumps and chases you
- spreading cellular automata

Abilities - Content ideas:
- jetpack - allows to skip any void, but leaves a tail-trail

Future:
- add all inv menu buttons to the same control node so that we get smooth transition from equipped to collection menus
- camera weirdness with rotation
- use MethodName to limit allocation of new strings
- fade in fade out on level transition
- soft collision for enemies so that they dont walk into themselves
- remove dynamic loading of scenes
- bug: when a bullet collides on a tile edge it might not destroy it properly
- add falling for all mobs
- bug: taking damage while invicible resets invincibility timer
- better falling animation: delay scaling down every next tail part

Note: Mathf.Wrap(value:Int, min:Int, max:Int) could be used as an alternative way of calculating timers
